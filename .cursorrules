You are building a production-style, cloud-portable full-stack RAG app.
Hard requirements:
- Kubernetes-first deployment (KubeRay + Ray Serve).
- Must deploy on Akamai LKE, AWS EKS, and GCP GKE with minimal drift.
- Use Helm for packaging + Kustomize overlays for provider diffs.
- No proprietary cloud services required for core function (use OSS defaults).
- Provide scripts: build, push, deploy, benchmark.
- Every manifest must be valid Kubernetes YAML; avoid pseudo fields.
- Pin versions in charts/manifests where feasible; avoid “latest”.
- Backend must expose /query, /ingest, /healthz, /metrics endpoints.
- Include Prometheus-compatible metrics and structured JSON logs.
If unsure about an API/version, write it as a TODO and isolate it to one file.

CONTEXT RULES:
- Always read docs/PROJECT_STATE.local.md if it exists; otherwise read docs/PROJECT_STATE.public.md.
- Always read docs/OPERATIONS.local.md if it exists; otherwise read docs/OPERATIONS.public.md.
- Never ask the user to paste tokens, kubeconfigs, or credentials into chat.
- Any command output included in docs/PROJECT_STATE.public.md must be sanitized (no tokens, cluster IDs, node names, IPs, kubeconfig paths).
