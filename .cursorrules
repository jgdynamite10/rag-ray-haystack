You are building a production-style, cloud-portable full-stack RAG app.
Hard requirements:
- Kubernetes-first deployment (KubeRay + Ray Serve).
- Must deploy on Akamai LKE, AWS EKS, and GCP GKE with minimal drift.
- Use Helm for packaging + Kustomize overlays for provider diffs.
- No proprietary cloud services required for core function (use OSS defaults).
- Provide scripts: build, push, deploy, benchmark.
- Every manifest must be valid Kubernetes YAML; avoid pseudo fields.
- Pin versions in charts/manifests where feasible; avoid “latest”.
- Backend must expose /query, /ingest, /healthz, /metrics endpoints.
- Include Prometheus-compatible metrics and structured JSON logs.
If unsure about an API/version, write it as a TODO and isolate it to one file.
